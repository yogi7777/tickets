This project was created for internal use. Under no circumstances should it be publicly accessible. No security checks have been implemented or reviewed.

ℹ️ Info:

📌 Content:
Short:
Employees can book day tickets that our company lends out.

Long:
On the homepage, users can book a product (day ticket) for a selected day without logging in. (Multiple tickets for the same product are possible, e.g., if a partner or children are joining.)
Products can have a description, an image, and serial numbers.
The booking confirmation is sent via email.

In the admin dashboard (password-protected), multiple users can be created.
Tickets are managed in a table view.
A booked ticket from an employee appears as a pending request in the table.
The request is marked as "Pending" and can later be marked as "Picked up" and then "Returned."
Admins also have the option to cancel a request.

🛑 The project is only available in German.
